    <h3>What is the Waterpolo?</h3>

        <p>
          Waterpolo is a competitive team sport played in water, where two teams of seven players each aim to score goals by throwing a ball into the opposing team’s net. The game is played in a rectangular pool with designated goal areas, and each match consists of four quarters. Players must rely on swimming, treading water (often using an "eggbeater" kick for stability), and teamwork to pass, defend, and score. Contact is allowed, making it a physically demanding sport that requires both strength and endurance.
          <br><br>
          In addition to scoring, teams work to prevent opponents from achieving goals by blocking shots, intercepting passes, and using defensive tactics. Waterpolo combines elements of soccer, basketball, and swimming, making it unique and challenging. The game is popular worldwide, especially in Europe and North America, with professional leagues and competitions held globally, including the Olympics.

      <h3>History of the Club</h3>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          The Waterpolo Club of Granada was founded in 1985 by a group of passionate local swimmers who envisioned creating a team that could represent the city in regional and national competitions. Initially, the club began with modest resources, training in a small community pool and participating in local matches. Despite these humble beginnings, the commitment and enthusiasm of both players and supporters quickly made the club a staple in Granada's sports community, attracting talent from across the region.
          <br><br>
          Over the decades, the Waterpolo Club of Granada has grown significantly, earning recognition and respect on a national level. By the late 1990s, the team had secured its first major victory, winning the Southern Regional Championship. This win marked the start of a series of successes, including three Andalusian Cups and a prestigious bronze medal at the Spanish National Championship in 2010. Today, the club is celebrated not only for its achievements in competition but also for its dedication to training young athletes and fostering a love for waterpolo in the community.
